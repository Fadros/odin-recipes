            <li>Carrots</li>
        </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan</li>
